The dataset here published aim to show the potential outcome of an analysis done with [fbtrex](https://facebook.tracking.exposed), they are published only because:

  * we made profiles on our own, without associate it with any real person
  * we were following public profiles and official mainstream newspaper

The data collected by fbtrex are protected because:

  * the are not sensible in the first place (only public posts)
  * only the supporter using fbtrex has complete decision on the data provided
  * if analysis are done over the global dataset, the subject can't be "the users" but only phenomenas, and the users are anonymized in the process
